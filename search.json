    "text": "NCAA men’s basketball has captured the attention of many sports fans… especially in March. When the games air on TV or are attended in person, it seems the more energy the crowd brings the better the home team does.\nLooking at the total attendance throughout the NCAA men’s basketball this past season shows a definite sign of loyalty, this paired with home wins can strike up curiosity within the numbers. There are two top conferences that battle it out for the best NCAA conference in men’s basketball.\nSo what two conferences dominate in the high attendance home game wins? Let’s take a look at some numbers.\nTo find the best conferences, we’ll take the entire 2024-25 season of NCAA men’s basketball and find the top-15 teams when looking at the total home wins and accumulative attendance throughout the home game wins.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggnewscale)\n\ngames &lt;- read_csv(\"NCAA mens bball - Sheet1.csv\")\nattendance &lt;- read_csv(\"NCAA mens bball attendance - Sheet1.csv\")\n\ncleangames &lt;- games |&gt; \nmutate(Team = gsub(\"(AQ)\",\"\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\nmutate(Team = gsub(\"(CA)\",\" CA\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\nmutate(Team = gsub(\"(NY)\",\" NY\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\nmutate(Team = gsub(\"(OH)\",\" OH\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\nmutate(Team = gsub(\"(FL)\",\" FL\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\nmutate(Team = gsub(\"(PA)\",\" PA\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \nseparate(WL, into=c(\"TotalWins\", \"TotalLosses\"), sep = \"-\") |&gt; \nseparate(RoadWL, into=c(\"RoadWins\", \"RoadLosses\"), sep = \"-\")\n\nhomewins &lt;- cleangames |&gt; \n  mutate(HomeWins = as.numeric(TotalWins) - as.numeric(RoadWins)) |&gt; \n  select(Team, Conference, `NET Rank`, HomeWins)\n\nselectedattendance &lt;- attendance |&gt; \n  select(Institution, Conference, Rank, `Accum Attendance`, `Avg Attendance`) |&gt; \n  rename(Team = Institution)\n\nattendancewins &lt;- homewins |&gt; inner_join(selectedattendance)\n\nattendancewins |&gt; \n  select(Team, Conference,HomeWins, `Accum Attendance`) |&gt; \n  top_n(15) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Team = \"Team\",\n    Conference = \"Conference\",\n    HomeWins= \"Home Wins\", \n   `Accum Attendance` = \"Total Attendance\") |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Which NCAA Conference Has The Most Home Wins and Best Total Attendance?\",\n    subtitle = \"The current top 15 teams are performing the best while in front of the most.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Ella Siegle |**Source:** NCAA Statistics\")) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt; \n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color= \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Conference == \"SEC\")\n    ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color= \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Conference == \"Big Ten\")\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich NCAA Conference Has The Most Home Wins and Best Total Attendance?\n\n\nThe current top 15 teams are performing the best while in front of the most.\n\n\nTeam\nConference\nHome Wins\nTotal Attendance\n\n\n\n\nTennessee\nSEC\n21\n340436\n\n\nMaryland\nBig Ten\n20\n253972\n\n\nKentucky\nSEC\n18\n366007\n\n\nWisconsin\nBig Ten\n20\n255109\n\n\nIllinois\nBig Ten\n16\n256543\n\n\nKansas\nBig 12\n17\n260100\n\n\nLouisville\nACC\n18\n252681\n\n\nBYU\nBig 12\n18\n289921\n\n\nMarquette\nBig East\n16\n264705\n\n\nNorth Carolina\nACC\n16\n307821\n\n\nCreighton\nBig East\n18\n295217\n\n\nArkansas\nSEC\n16\n341935\n\n\nIndiana\nBig Ten\n15\n296046\n\n\nDayton\nAtlantic 10\n16\n241328\n\n\nSyracuse\nACC\n12\n321103\n\n\n\nBy: Ella Siegle |Source: NCAA Statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust in the top-five the Big Ten and SEC dominate the books. This means out of all the games played, Tennessee had the most home wins with 21 and one of the largest SEC team attendance with over 340,000 fans accumulating throughout the season. That is over 20,000 fans each regular season game. Maryland follows shortly behind with 20 home wins and averaging over 250,000 fans.\nTo put this in a local perspective, Nebraska had 12 home wins and over 230,000 fans throughout the 2024-25 season which isn’t far from Maryland’s attendance, yet eight fewer home wins. Maybe fans don’t play a role… ehhh, Nebraska just… struggles.\nStats, stats, stats, with basketball comes numbers which comes ranks. The Big Ten and SEC are the obvious two conference dominators. To understand these teams further, where does each team rank with net ranks and attendance ranks combined?\n\n\nCode\nbigten &lt;- attendancewins |&gt; \ngroup_by(Team, Conference, HomeWins, `Avg Attendance`, `Accum Attendance`) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    Net_Rank = sum(`NET Rank`), \n    Attendance_Rank = sum(Rank)) |&gt;\n  filter(Conference == \"Big Ten\")\n\nBIGSEC &lt;- attendancewins |&gt; \ngroup_by(Team, Conference, HomeWins, `Avg Attendance`, `Accum Attendance`) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    Net_Rank = sum(`NET Rank`), \n    Attendance_Rank = sum(Rank)) |&gt;\n  filter(Conference == \"SEC\" | Conference == \"Big Ten\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=BIGSEC, \n    aes(y=reorder(Team, Attendance_Rank), x=Attendance_Rank, xend=Net_Rank), \n    size = 1.5,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Attendance and Net Ranks\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"The Battle Between The Big Ten and SEC Ranks\", \n    subtitle=\"The best teams have &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;Red&lt;/span&gt; on the left for net ranks and &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;Green&lt;/span&gt; on the right for attendance ranks. \", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA Statistics | Ella Siegle\"\n    ) +\ntheme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour out of the first five teams belong to the Big Ten. The red indicates the teams’ net rank and the green showcases the teams’ accumulated attendance over the season. There is something both of these conferences have in common. Yes, diehard fans, but every conference has those teams… these two have money, an abundance of it.\nAs NIL increases and both conference schools get bigger, of course they will be the two best conferences in all of NCAA basketball. The best of the best players will come play at a school in either conference.\n\n\nCode\nconfs &lt;- c(\"ACC\",\"Big 12\",\"Big Ten\",\"Big East\",\"Mountain West\",\"Atlantic 10\",\"MVC\",\"CUSA\",\"WCC\",\"SEC\", \"The American\", \"Ivy League\", \"WAC\", \"Sun Belt\", \"CAA\", \"MAC\", \"Summit League\", \"Big South\")\n\nselectedconference &lt;- attendancewins |&gt; \n  select(Conference, `Accum Attendance`, HomeWins) |&gt; \n  filter(Conference %in% confs ) |&gt;\n  group_by(Conference, HomeWins) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    total_attendance = sum(`Accum Attendance`),\n    total_wins = sum(HomeWins)\n  )\n\nbig10 &lt;- selectedconference |&gt; \nfilter(Conference== \"Big Ten\")\n\nsec &lt;- selectedconference |&gt; \n  filter(Conference== \"SEC\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=selectedconference,aes(x=reorder(Conference, total_wins), weight=total_wins), fill= \"lightgrey\")+\n  geom_bar(\n    data=big10, aes(x=reorder(Conference, total_wins), weight=total_wins),fill= \"red\")+\n  geom_bar(\n    data=sec,aes(x=reorder(Conference, total_wins), weight=total_wins), fill= \"blue\")+\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Total Home Wins\", \n    title=\"The Big Ten and SEC Stand Neck and Neck\", \n    subtitle=\"The Big Ten and SEC battle it out with most home wins in NCAA this 2024-25 season.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA Statistics | Ella Siegle\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Big Ten and SEC are neck and neck.Gliding past every other conference, the red and blue stand tied with the most home wins this past season.\nThe powerhouses will stay powerhouses… these two conferences aren’t going anywhere."
