    "section": "",
    "text": "The fan-owned organization in Green Bay continues to produce unprecedented back-to-back franchise quarterbacks.\nThe Packers often draft potential, not starters. Favre started as a back up in Atlanta before coming to Green Bay and becoming one of the best quarterbacks in league history. Aaron Rodgers spent three years as Favre’s understudy before stepping into the starting role and making him arguably one of the best to ever do it. How many years did Jordan Love back-up Rodgers? Three. The years spent observing and mastering the craft of being a professional quarterback at the Packers far outshines any other NFL team.\nJordan Love came off of a rocky 2024-25 season. He battled a knee injury early on and continued to fight through it game after game. A season like his and following Rodgers legacy can’t be easy. Expectations were set high after following Rodger’s, but Love’s consistency, composure and leadership skills continue to stand out. While the 2024-25 season may have not been record-breaking, Love’s locker room presence suggested long term presence. With the 2025 NFL Draft completed, the Packers are left with a high potential playoff team. Through camps, practices, recovery and film… will Jordan Love have what it takes to be the next Packer legacy?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggnewscale)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\npackerqbs &lt;- read_csv(\"packerqbs - Sheet1.csv\")\nnflqbrush &lt;- read_csv(\"qb_rushing_19752024.csv\")\nnflqbpassing &lt;- read_csv(\"nfl_qb_passing_19752024.csv\")\n\npackerpassing &lt;- nflqbpassing |&gt; \nselect( Player, Team, PassingYds, TD, Int, Season, Cmp, Att, SackYds, `Y/G`) |&gt; \n  filter(Team==\"GNB\")\n\nqbs &lt;- nflqbpassing |&gt; \n  filter(\n    PassingYds &gt; 2300,\n    `Cmp%` &gt; 30\n  )\n\npackers &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Team==\"GNB\" & \n    Player ==\"Brett Favre\" |\n    Player ==\"Aaron Rodgers\")\n\nfavre &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Team==\"GNB\" & \n    Player ==\"Brett Favre\") |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Season == 1995 | Season == 1996 | Season == 1997\n  )\n\nrodgers &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Team==\"GNB\" & \n    Player ==\"Aaron Rodgers\") |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Season == 2011 | Season == 2014 | Season == 2020 | Season == 2021\n  )\n  \nlove &lt;- qbs |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Player==\"Jordan Love\"\n  )\n\npackersmvp &lt;- bind_rows(favre, rodgers, love)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=qbs, aes(x=PassingYds, y=`Cmp%`), color=\"lightgrey\", alpha = .3) +\n  geom_point(data=packers, aes(x=PassingYds, y=`Cmp%`), color = \"darkgreen\", size=2, alpha=.3) +\n  geom_point(data=packersmvp, aes(x=PassingYds, y=`Cmp%`), color = \"darkgreen\", size=2) +\n  geom_point(data=love, aes(x=PassingYds, y=`Cmp%`), color = \"#B59410\", size=2) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=5000, y=80, label=\"Great Passing, Better Completion\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2850, y=50, label=\"Average Passing, Lower Completion\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=packersmvp, aes(x=PassingYds, y=`Cmp%`, label = Player, Season)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Passing Yards\",\n    y=\"Competion Percentage\",\n    title=\"Precision and Production\",\n    subtitle=\"MVP seasons in green, Love shines early in his career.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference  | By: Ella Siegle\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMVP’s are handed on a silver platter at Lambeau. Jordan Love continues to keep up with the greats’ and their high performing numbers. In 2023, Jordan Love made an impressive playoff run starting the chatter of another Packer franchise quarterback. Love threw for 4,159 yards, three touchdowns and a 96.1% passer rating, allowing him to prove himself amongst other league greats.\nOf the 2024 quarterbacks, how did Love rank in agility within the pocket?\n\n\nCode\nnfl &lt;- nflqbpassing |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Season == \"2024\") |&gt;  \n  top_n(20)\n\nsacks&lt;- nfl |&gt;  \n  filter(Sk &gt; 0) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Sk))\n\nsackpercent &lt;- nfl |&gt;  \nfilter(`Sk%` &gt; 0) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(`Sk%`))\n\nlovesacks &lt;- nfl |&gt;  \n  filter(Player ==\"Jordan Love\")\n\nmaliksacks &lt;- nfl |&gt;  \n  filter(Player ==\"Malik Willis\")\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() + \ngeom_bar(\ndata=sacks, aes(x=reorder(Player, Sk), weight= Sk), fill= \"lightgrey\") + \ngeom_bar(\n  data=lovesacks, aes(x=reorder(Player, Sk), weight=Sk), fill=\"#FFB612\") +\ngeom_bar(\n  data=maliksacks, aes(x=reorder(Player, Sk), weight=Sk), fill=\"darkgreen\") +\ncoord_flip() + \nlabs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Amount Sacked\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + \ngeom_bar(\ndata=sackpercent, aes(x=reorder(Player, `Sk%`), weight= `Sk%`), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(\n  data=lovesacks, aes(x=reorder(Player, `Sk%`), weight=`Sk%`), fill=\"#FFB612\") +\n  geom_bar(\n  data=maliksacks, aes(x=reorder(Player, `Sk%`), weight=`Sk%`), fill=\"darkgreen\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Sack Percentage\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nbar1 + bar2 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"QB durability when pressure hits\",\n    subtitle = \"Willis has a high sack rate despite limited action.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By: Ella Siegle\"\n  ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPocket presence is often overlooked. It can differentiate good quarterbacks from greats. Love held his own in the pocket allowing limited sacks and an even less sack percentage. Now… Malik Willis. What team does he play for? Oh yeah, the Packers. Willis became Love’s back-up quarterback the 2024-25 season. He appeared in seven games while Love was battling his injury. Although he is just barely under Love in sacks, his sack percentage is the poorest in the NFL. Willis was running for his life behind the line of scrimmage. His drop backs and movement up the pocket increase his sack percentage immensely. Although bad for Willis, this exemplifies the fact that Love continues to be agile through high pressure plays, taking fewer unnecessary sacks. Another reason he is a potential Packer legacy.\nNow, how does Love compare to the rest of the Packer greats?\n\n\nCode\npackqbs &lt;- packerqbs |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Cmp &gt; 350,\n    TD &gt; 30) |&gt; \n  top_n(15)\n\npackqbs |&gt; \n  select(Player, `Y/G` ,`From`, `To`) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(`Y/G`)) |&gt; \n  top_n(15) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Player = \"Player\",\n    `Y/G` = \"Avg Yards Per Game\",\n    From= \"From\", \n    To = \"To\") |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Love's place in Packers history\",\n    subtitle = \"Jordan Love compared to the top 10 Packer quarterbacks.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Ella Siegle | **Source:** Pro Football Reference\")) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt; \n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color= \"darkgreen\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"#FFB612\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Aaron Rodgers\")\n    ) |&gt; \n   tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color= \"darkgreen\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"#FFB612\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Brett Favre\")\n    ) |&gt; \n   tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color= \"darkgreen\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"#FFB612\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Jordan Love\")\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove's place in Packers history\n\n\nJordan Love compared to the top 10 Packer quarterbacks.\n\n\nPlayer\nAvg Yards Per Game\nFrom\nTo\n\n\n\n\nAaron Rodgers\n256.8\n2005\n2022\n\n\nBrett Favre\n241.8\n1992\n2007\n\n\nLynn Dickey\n203.5\n1976\n1985\n\n\nJordan Love\n194.1\n2021\n2024\n\n\nDon Majkowski\n159.9\n1987\n1992\n\n\nRandy Wright\n154.5\n1984\n1988\n\n\nTobin Rote\n137.3\n1950\n1956\n\n\nBart Starr\n126.1\n1956\n1971\n\n\nCecil Isbell\n110.1\n1938\n1942\n\n\n\nBy: Ella Siegle | Source: Pro Football Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAaron Rodgers, Brett Favre, Lynn Dickey…. Jordan Love. Love averages a high amount of passing yards each game giving him the fourth best spot at quarterback with the green and gold. Love was drafted to the pack in 2021, getting his first start in 2023. Despite limited time as a starting quarterback, Love’s stats continue to impress the books. While Favre started 15 years with the pack and Rodgers 17, Love’s early placement among franchise leaders is notable.\nAt the end of the day, Jordan Love is already a franchise quarterback at Lambeau Field. He wins the hearts of Packer fans across the world… yes, across the world. From his early development to his early success, Love captures the essence of a poissed leader. There is something about Lambeau Field that breeds quarterbacks better than any other team. Love has already begun writing his own legacy in the green and gold."

    "text": "NCAA men’s basketball has captured the attention of many sports fans… especially in March. When the games air on TV or are attended in person, it seems the more energy the crowd brings the better the home team does.\nLooking at the total attendance throughout the NCAA men’s basketball this past season shows a definite sign of loyalty, this paired with home wins can strike up curiosity within the numbers. There are two top conferences that battle it out for the best NCAA conference in men’s basketball.\nSo what two conferences dominate in the high attendance home game wins? Let’s take a look at some numbers.\nTo find the best conferences, we’ll take the entire 2024-25 season of NCAA men’s basketball and find the top-15 teams when looking at the total home wins and accumulative attendance throughout the home game wins.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggnewscale)\n\ngames &lt;- read_csv(\"NCAA mens bball - Sheet1.csv\")\nattendance &lt;- read_csv(\"NCAA mens bball attendance - Sheet1.csv\")\n\ncleangames &lt;- games |&gt; \nmutate(Team = gsub(\"(AQ)\",\"\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\nmutate(Team = gsub(\"(CA)\",\" CA\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\nmutate(Team = gsub(\"(NY)\",\" NY\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\nmutate(Team = gsub(\"(OH)\",\" OH\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\nmutate(Team = gsub(\"(FL)\",\" FL\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\nmutate(Team = gsub(\"(PA)\",\" PA\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \nseparate(WL, into=c(\"TotalWins\", \"TotalLosses\"), sep = \"-\") |&gt; \nseparate(RoadWL, into=c(\"RoadWins\", \"RoadLosses\"), sep = \"-\")\n\nhomewins &lt;- cleangames |&gt; \n  mutate(HomeWins = as.numeric(TotalWins) - as.numeric(RoadWins)) |&gt; \n  select(Team, Conference, `NET Rank`, HomeWins)\n\nselectedattendance &lt;- attendance |&gt; \n  select(Institution, Conference, Rank, `Accum Attendance`, `Avg Attendance`) |&gt; \n  rename(Team = Institution)\n\nattendancewins &lt;- homewins |&gt; inner_join(selectedattendance)\n\nattendancewins |&gt; \n  select(Team, Conference,HomeWins, `Accum Attendance`) |&gt; \n  top_n(15) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Team = \"Team\",\n    Conference = \"Conference\",\n    HomeWins= \"Home Wins\", \n   `Accum Attendance` = \"Total Attendance\") |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Which NCAA Conference Has The Most Home Wins and Best Total Attendance?\",\n    subtitle = \"The current top 15 teams are performing the best while in front of the most.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Ella Siegle |**Source:** NCAA Statistics\")) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt; \n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color= \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Conference == \"SEC\")\n    ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color= \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Conference == \"Big Ten\")\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich NCAA Conference Has The Most Home Wins and Best Total Attendance?\n\n\nThe current top 15 teams are performing the best while in front of the most.\n\n\nTeam\nConference\nHome Wins\nTotal Attendance\n\n\n\n\nTennessee\nSEC\n21\n340436\n\n\nMaryland\nBig Ten\n20\n253972\n\n\nKentucky\nSEC\n18\n366007\n\n\nWisconsin\nBig Ten\n20\n255109\n\n\nIllinois\nBig Ten\n16\n256543\n\n\nKansas\nBig 12\n17\n260100\n\n\nLouisville\nACC\n18\n252681\n\n\nBYU\nBig 12\n18\n289921\n\n\nMarquette\nBig East\n16\n264705\n\n\nNorth Carolina\nACC\n16\n307821\n\n\nCreighton\nBig East\n18\n295217\n\n\nArkansas\nSEC\n16\n341935\n\n\nIndiana\nBig Ten\n15\n296046\n\n\nDayton\nAtlantic 10\n16\n241328\n\n\nSyracuse\nACC\n12\n321103\n\n\n\nBy: Ella Siegle |Source: NCAA Statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust in the top-five the Big Ten and SEC dominate the books.

That is over 20,000 fans each regular season game. Maryland follows shortly behind with 20 home wins and averaging over 250,000 fans.\nTo put this in a local perspective, Nebraska had 12 home wins and over 230,000 fans throughout the 2024-25 season which isn’t far from Maryland’s attendance, yet eight fewer home wins. Maybe fans don’t play a role… ehhh, Nebraska just… struggles.\nStats, stats, stats, with basketball comes numbers which comes ranks. The Big Ten and SEC are the obvious two conference dominators.
